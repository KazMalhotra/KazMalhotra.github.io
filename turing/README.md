Turing-Welchman Bonbe


During WWII, there were some people of monumental importance of whom you may never have heard. Great Britain had major problems on its hands as the Nazis had what seemed to be an unbreakable code. The allies could intercept messages, but not decode them, so their interceptions became useless. A team at Bletchley park eventually cracked the Nazi’s code, and became an insturmental part of the war. Consequently, Alan Turing and Bletchley park enabled an allied victory in WWII and have shaped life in the twenty-first century. They enabled the Allies to win WWII, causing the people in power to change. Their work changed the fate of the of land and the technology they enabled has revolutionized the world in both extremely good and bad ways.

During WWII, England didn’t have enough food. The Americans were sending ships of bread to England. These ships were being sunk by the Nazis. To communicate messages, the Nazis used their Enigma Machine (Ranganathan, TEDx). The Enigma machine was a very sophisticated machine. Even when the allies intercepted messages from the Nazis, it was very difficult for them to decode and decipher any messages that they intercepted. Because of this, the Germans could stage a surprise attack on allied food transports without the allies knowing anything. It stands to reason, therefore, that a discovery of how to crack the Enigma would prove imperative to the allies. 

A team was set up at Bletchley Park consisting of cryptologists, codebreakers, mathematicians, and engineers (Lewis). Despite having many of the best scholars in their respective fields, the team at Bletchley Park was unsuccessful for a while. In 1938, Alan Turing, a King's College graduate, became part of this team at Bletchley park (Hodges 1).
The Polish were the first to realize Enigma would most likely be cracked by a cryptologist or mathematician (The Enigma of...). In 1932, a team of Polish cryptanalysts figured out some of the internal wiring of the Enigma machine. In 1938 with this information, they developed their ‘Bomba’ machine (Copeland). The problem with the Bomba machine was that it relied on certain German operating procedures to function. The Germans changed some of these procedures and the Bomba machine was rendered almost useless (Copeland). In 1939-1940, the team at Bletchley Park developed their machine known as the Bombe machine. While this had some similarities with the Bomba, it was very different (The Turing-Welchman Bombe...).
One of the things that made the Enigma machine so hard to crack, was that none of the allies knew how it worked, and the Nazi’s changed the ‘key’ every day. You needed to have the key and an Enigma machine in order to decipher the messages. The allies got an Enigma machine by attacking a German boat and recovering its machine. This was later dubbed Operation Primrose (MacNeil). What Turing’s team figured out was how to get the key every day. They realized the fatal flaw of the Enigma was that no letter could ever be encoded as itself (The Turing-Welchman Bombe). For example, the letter E could be encoded as anything but E.

Now that Turing and the team at Bletchley park had cracked the Enigma, they had to figure out how to save as many lives as possible without alerting the Germans they had cracked their code. They needed to do this because while the Nazi’s were unaware of the fact that the allies cracked their ‘uncrackable’ code, they would continue to send each other messages that could be intercepted and used by the allies. If the Nazi’s were aware the Allies cracked their code, they could feed them false information or stop communication entirely, meaning the allies would have to start all over again.
The incerception and deciphering of Nazi messages enabled the British to get the food and supplies to fight the Nazi’s during WWII. Turing’s Bombe machine now allowed the allies to receive food and materials from the Americans and is estimated to have saved two million lives (Drury). The food and materials from the Americans were an invaluable resource to the allies. 

Not only did Turing and the team at Bletchley park shape the outcome of the war, but they also made significant advancements to technology. Alan Turing has become a very well known name in the computer science, mathematics, and engineering communities. He revolutionized these fields with his papers and hypotheses. 

Turing’s paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence is seen as a masterpiece not just in computer science, but also in philosophy (Hodges 2). He enabled many fields such as artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and much of computer science in general. Because of his many contributions, the Turing Award is considered the highest honor in computing, and often called The Nobel Prize Of Computing (A.M Turing Award). He was a pioneer in computing, cryptography, and mathematics. His work indirectly enabled Tim Berners-Lee to invent the internet, bringing us simultaneously closer together and farther apart. Technology enabled by him allowed us to run massive protein folding simulations and fight diseases like Alzheimer's (Alzheimer's Disease). Technology enabled by him allowed us to have much of the world’s information at our fingertips. But also subjected us to the misinformation we are led to believe. Turing, of course, was not the sole creator of any of these technologies. Even at Bletchley Park, he had a team of brilliant people working with him to win the war. But without him, these technologies would not exist. Charles Babbage built the first computer, Ada Lovelace programmed it making her the first programmer, but Alan Turing defined, in abstract terms, what a computer could be. 

Because Turing’s contributions to society and technology were kept secret, he was forced to never speak of his time at Bletchley park. Because Turing was gay, and at the time, homosexuality was a crime (Alan Turing's Homosexual...), he was prosecuted in 1952 (Alan Turing’s Trial). The judge gave him the choice to go to prison or to go on ‘chemical castration treatment’ which he chose (Tsoulis-Reay). In June of 1954, he died of cyanide poisoning (Pease). The official coroner decreed it a suicide, but many (including his mother) dispute that (Cowell). The investigators found half an apple near his bed with cyanide in it, presumably to mask the taste (Cowell). Some think his death is a result of his sentence of chemical castration (Cowell).

In conclusion, Alan Turing and Bletchley park were instrumental in an Allied victory in WWII and have revolutionized technology and enabled many fields which they could never see. Much of Turing’s work has had a major impact on fields that many rely on today, and the world would certainly be a very different place without his contributions.
